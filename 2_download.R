  # we will not need to re-build branches that have already run successfully. 
  # However, if a branch fails, {targets} will throw an error reading `could
  # not load dependencies of [immediate downstream target]. invalid 'description'
  # argument` because it cannot merge the individual branches and so did not  
  # complete the branching target. The error(s) associated with the failed branch 
  # will therefore need to be resolved before the full target can be successfully 
  # built. A common reason a branch may fail is due to WQP timeout errors. Timeout 
  # errors can sometimes be resolved by waiting a few hours and retrying tar_make().
